# react-revisit
Looking to expand react understanding


## pure-react branch
basic setup. Used scripts to bring in react and babel.  
Render to the DOM an H1 with inline style.  
```
<h1 id='title' className='header' style={{backgroundColor: 'orange', color: 'white', fontFamily: 'verdana'}}>Hello World</h1>,
    document.getElementById('react-container')
```
##activity branch

Project to get the head wrapped around older react and how to deal with it.
